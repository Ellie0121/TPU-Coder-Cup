![cloud space banner](https://github.com/sophgo/TPU-Coder-Cup/assets/117440498/0da83dc9-71e2-4a55-bb34-104ddc5d3fa6)
[SOPHON.NET](https://cloud.sophgo.com/developer/cloudSpace/index?lang=EN) provides a **cloud** development space integrating training and reasoning to provide convenient cloud resources for algorithm development and testing which includes **Standard Cloud Development Space**, **TPU Programming Competition Cloud Space**, and **Cloud Desktop Space**. So algorithm development is no longer limited to hardware. The **TPU Programming Competition Cloud Space** offers a **dedicated** cloud test environment for the **TPU Programming Competition**, utilizing the Ubuntu system. [Cloud Space Usage Tutorial](https://cloud.sophgo.com/static/tpu-en.pdf) introduces the application and usage details of the platform.


## Sophon SDK
**Sophgo** provides a series of original deep learning development kits including **BMNNSDK**, **Sophon-Inference**, **TPU-MLIR**, **Model Zoo**, etc. Brief description and links of are as follows.
![sophon_inference](https://github.com/sophgo/TPU-Coder-Cup/assets/117440498/55005a31-5284-4876-bf4c-f442044e4e69)


 - [BMNNSDK](https://www.sophon.ai/product/introduce/bmnn-sdk.html), a deep learning **SDK** based on BM AI chip, with its powerful tools, you can deploy the deep learning application in the runtime environment, and deliver the maximum inference throughput and efficiency.
 - [Sophon-Inference](https://github.com/sophon-ai-algo/sophon-inference), Sophon Artificial Intelligent **Library** for **online deployment**(**SAIL**), a wrapper of bmruntime, bmdecoder, bmcv, bmlib. It provides both C++ and Python APIs utomatically managing memory of tensors. It can be compiled on a Linux/Windows10 host with x86 architecture to generate a corresponding version of the dynamic library and Python Wheel file, and can also configure a cross-compiler and compile a dynamic library and Python Wheel file under other architectures.
 - [TPU-MLIR](https://tpumlir.org), an [open-source](https://github.com/sophgo/tpu-mlir) machine-learning **compiler** based on **MLIR for TPU**. This project provides a complete toolchain, which can convert pre-trained neural networks from different frameworks into binary files **bmodel** that can be efficiently operated on TPUs.
