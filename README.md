![cloud space banner](https://github.com/sophgo/TPU-Coder-Cup/assets/117440498/0da83dc9-71e2-4a55-bb34-104ddc5d3fa6)
[SOPHON.NET](https://cloud.sophgo.com/developer/cloudSpace/index?lang=EN) provides a **cloud** development space integrating training and reasoning to provide convenient cloud resources for algorithm development and testing which includes **Standard Cloud Development Space**, **TPU Programming Competition Cloud Space**, and **Cloud Desktop Space**. So algorithm development is no longer limited to hardware. The **TPU Programming Competition Cloud Space** offers a **dedicated** cloud test environment for the **TPU Programming Competition**, utilizing the Ubuntu system. [Cloud Space Usage Tutorial](https://cloud.sophgo.com/static/tpu-en.pdf) introduces the application and usage details of the platform.


## SOPHON SDK
**Sophgo** provides a series of original deep learning development kits including **BMNNSDK**, **Sophon-Inference**, **TPU-MLIR**, **Model Zoo**, etc. Brief description and links of are as follows.
